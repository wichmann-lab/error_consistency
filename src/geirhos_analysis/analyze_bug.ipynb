    "## Bug Analysis\n",

    "In this notebook, we analyze the impact of a minor bug in model-vs-human: In the calculation of Error Consistency, the border conditions are not handled properly: If one observer gets a perfect score, the EC is 1 automatically, which is not necessarily correct, and we think it's better to return NaN in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we load two dataframes of model-vs-human data, one which was created with the bug, the other without (by just changing one line in utils.py to return 1 instead of NaN, then running `bootstrap_models.py -n 1`). \n",
    "\n",
    "We find that this only has an impact on two models, `efficientnet_l2_noisy_student_475` and `transformer_L16_IN21K`, because no other model got a perfect condition anywhere.\n",
    "We here plot how these models would have been ranked using our way of doing it, but since the experiments have such a different distribution of values, the impact of not including the NaN-experiments in the mean is very large.\n",
    "\n",
    "It would probably be better to z-transform all error-consistency scores first, before averaging, and this would probably have a large impact on the ranking as well."
